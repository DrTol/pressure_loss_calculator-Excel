# Pressure Loss Calculator Tool - Excel (SI Units)
An Excel add-in allowing functions to calculate the friction pressure loss (head loss) in circular pipes with full flow water. Matlab functions for the same calculator/s can be found in [pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab.git).

Please enjoy the example Excel file [examplePressureLoss&RoughnessConverters.xlsm](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Excel/blob/master/examplePressureLoss%26RoughnessConverters.xlsm) making use of the modules/User-Defined-Functions(UDFs) (given in the folder [Modules-UDFs](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Excel/tree/master/Modules-UDFs)) required for pressure loss calculation as built-in in this xlsm file - so you don't need to load the Excel Add-In [ExcelAdd-In_PressureLoss.xlam](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Excel/blob/master/ExcelAdd-In_PressureLoss.xlam) to this xlsm Excel file. 

Further explanations coming soon.
