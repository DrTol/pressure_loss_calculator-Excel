# Pressure Loss Calculator Tool - Excel (SI Units)
An Excel add-in with User-Defined-Functions to calculate the friction pressure loss (head loss) in circular pipes with full flow water. The pressure loss calculator function has the selective options for the friction loss formulations, can be selected as either "Hazen-Williams" or as "Darcy-Weisbach". For the latter, another selective options are possible for the equation calculating of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (details given in [Features](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Excel/blob/master/README.md#features)). Besides, another functions are given to convert between the roughness factors/coefficients, made use of in the Darcy-Weisbach and the Hazen-Williams formulations.

Matlab functions for the same calculator/s can be found in [pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab.git](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab.git).

Please enjoy the example Excel file [examplePressureLoss&RoughnessConverters.xlsm](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Excel/blob/master/examplePressureLoss%26RoughnessConverters.xlsm) making use of the modules/User-Defined-Functions(UDFs) (given in the folder [Modules-UDFs](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Excel/tree/master/Modules-UDFs)) required for pressure loss calculation as built-in in this xlsm file - so you don't need to load the Excel Add-In [ExcelAdd-In_PressureLoss.xlam](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Excel/blob/master/ExcelAdd-In_PressureLoss.xlam) to this xlsm Excel file.
